One way to solve this is by facorization. If two numbers DO NOT share a common factor, the numbers are coprime. To check, we take the factorization of 1105 (5 × 13 × 17) and the factorization of $n$ and check to see if they have any common factors. For example, 1105 and 25 share the common factor of 5, thus they are NOT coprime to each other. \r\n",

If the number is prime, it should pass the test. However, (bppp) - which in our case is 1105 - is NOT PRIME and passes the FLT test. This makes 1105 a psuedoprime. We can see this by testing each coprime number: $ (((n ^ {bbbp}) - n)\\mod n)$ If the answer is $0$ (and (bbbp) is prime), then it has fooled the FLT test.
